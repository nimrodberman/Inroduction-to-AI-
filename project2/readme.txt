Running Instructions

Hey 1 ! welcome to our assignment 2. Introduction to AI :)
There are 2 example for different seniors where the optimal results are different.

1. 'difference_example_1_2.txt':

- This example show the difference between the first and second game modes.
 Detailed analysis is in the accompanying report.

- To run this example go to 'main.py' and disable this line of code:
    'graph = Parser().parse_file_to_graph('difference_example_1_3.txt')'
 and enable this line of code:
    'graph = Parser().parse_file_to_graph('difference_example_1_2.txt')'
  Then just play the game where once the mode is 1 and once when the mode is 2. In both cases initial positions are
  first_player = 2 , second_player = 3

2. This example show the difference between the first and the third game modes.
 Detailed analysis is in the accompanying report.

- To run this example go to 'main.py' and disable this line of code:
    'graph = Parser().parse_file_to_graph('difference_example_1_2.txt')'
    and enable this line of code:
    'graph = Parser().parse_file_to_graph('difference_example_1_3.txt')'
    Then just play the game where once the mode is 1 and once when the mode is 3. In both cases initial positions are
    first_player = 2 , second_player = 4
