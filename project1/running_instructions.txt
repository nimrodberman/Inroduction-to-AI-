There are two experiments. no special installation is required. we used python 3.8 but any other version is fine.
The first one is using 'env.txt'. The second is using 'env2.txt'.
To run the first experiment, use the following command:
1. Go to 'main.py' and choose the agent type global variable:
    agent_type = "AStarHeuristicAgent"
    agent_type = "AStarRealTimeHeuristicAgent"
    agent_type = "HeuristicGreedyAgent"
2. Set the T value
3.play run - see the printout of the results in the console.
To switch to the second experiment, use the 'env2.txt' file. Elaboration of the two experiments is in the report.




example of a run of AStarRealTimeHeuristicAgent:
